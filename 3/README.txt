prob3.py is an implementation of 'machine scheduling' with greedy algorithm

a.txt and b.txt are sample inputs for prob3 (file input required)
these files are of the format:
3
1,4
5,6
3,5
where the first line is the number of tasks to be scheduled and the following lines are all 'start,end' times for that task

io_example.png shows how to run the algorithm from the shell using a.txt and b.txt as file inputs, along with the output
